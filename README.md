# Pacman
During My Membership with ACM, I participated in the Advanced PacMan Game Project.During Tuseday from 3:00 - 4:20pm we would have meetings and collaborate on building mazes and programming feature into our game. It was a three month project where we programmed on Unity and Visual Stduio 2019 using the Language C#. During the first week i designed paths for PacMan using the walls, and impletmented the pellets for Pacman to eat while journing through the maze.
